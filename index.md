# Summary
Machine learning researchers often express complex models as a program, relying on program transformations to add functionality. New languages and transformations (e.g., TorchScript and TensorFlow AutoGraph) are becoming core capabilities of ML libraries. However, existing transformations, such as automatic differentiation (AD), inference in probabilistic programming languages (PPL), and optimizing compilers are often built in isolation, and limited in scope. This workshop aims at viewing program transformations in ML in a unified light, making these capabilities more accessible, and building entirely new ones.

Program transformations are an area of active study. AD transforms a program performing numerical computation into one computing the gradient of those computations. In PPL, a program describing a sampling procedure can be modified to perform inference on model parameters given observations. Other examples are vectorizing a program expressed on one data point, and learned transformations where ML models use programs as inputs or outputs.

This workshop will bring together researchers in the fields of AD, programming languages, compilers, and ML, with the goal of understanding the commonalities between disparate approaches and views, and sharing ways to make these techniques broadly available. It would enable ML practitioners to iterate faster on novel models and architectures (e.g., those naturally expressed through high-level constructs like recursion).

## Topics
- Abstractions and syntax (beyond meta-programming and operator overloading) to naturally express a program (expression, or procedure) as an object to be manipulated
- Techniques from AD and PPL the ML community could adopt to enable research on new models
- How to overcome challenges due to the ML’s specific hardware (GPUs, specialized chips) and software (Python) stacks, and the particular demands of practitioners for their tools
- Greater collaboration between ML and programming languages communities

# Submissions
We are soliciting contributions bridging the gap between the AD, (P)PL, ML and/or compiler/systems communities. Submissions should be 2 to 4 pages extended abstracts. They do not need to be anonymized. Submissions are non-archival. Work can include:
- recent work on these topics which was published in non-ML venues;
- preliminary or novel work demonstrating applications of program transformation techniques to ML (but not finalized work already published);
- a summary of multiple previous contributions on program transformation techniques with potential applications for ML.

Please submit your abstracts at [openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2019/Workshop/Program_Transformations](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2019/Workshop/Program_Transformations).

Up to 6 submissions will be selected to give a contributed talk. The talks will be selected based on the quality of the submission, and with the aim of spanning the different research disciplines that this workshop aims to engage. Remaining submission will be considered for a poster session. Submissions will be reviewed by at least two, ideally three, people from the organizing committee, and will not be reviewed by people with a conflict of interest (i.e., a shared affiliation within the past 3 years).

The timeline for submissions is as follows:
- Monday 12 August, 2019: Submissions open
- Monday 16 September, 2019: Submissions deadline
- Wednesday 18 September, 2019: Reviewing period starts
- Wednesday 25 September, 2019: Reviews due
- Friday 27 September, 2019: Decision deadline
- Tuesday October 1, 2019: NeurIPS notification deadline

## Travel & registration support
We are planning to get sponsorship funding in order to support a part of the registration and/or travel costs of a number of attendees. If you require such assistance please let the organizers know by sending an email at the time of paper submission. More information will be available in due course.

# Tentative schedule
The aim of our workshop is to bridge the gap between several research communities. We will use a format that includes a relatively large number of talks (10) with the aim of covering breadth rather than depth, allowing people from different backgrounds to make relevant connections. The poster session will be the opportunity for small groups to form and discuss topics of interest. The day will conclude with a panel to kickstart discussions that we hope will continue after the workshop has ended (i.e, on how to improve existing ML tooling, or the exploration of modern PL ideas in the context of ML).

# Access to content
In order to provide access to the members of the machine learning community who cannot attend NeurIPS in person, we are planning to arrange the video recording of all the talks delivered in the workshop and potentially live stream these on YouTube during the event. We will provide talk summaries, videos, and presentation slides on our workshop website, along with all accepted papers and corresponding posters. We are planning to publish a workshop summary following the event, highlighting the main emerging trends and subjects discussed in our workshop.

# Previous related workshops
In the past, we organized a similar workshop on AD for machine learning at NeurIPS [2016](https://autodiff-workshop.github.io/2016.html) and [2017](https://autodiff-workshop.github.io). This year, we are broadening the scope of the workshop to involve more types of semantic program transformations, in particular for probabilistic programming, and hope to attract more experts in programming languages and compiler design as attendees.

Another similar effort was started this year at POPL, where the probabilistic programming languages workshop (PPL) became “Languages for Inference” ([LAFI](https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/lafi-2019)), bringing machine learning and differentiable programming into a programming languages conference. We believe that events with these goals should happen both in machine learning and programming language conferences, in order to help bridge these gaps and foster greater collaborations.
